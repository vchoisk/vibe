Real Photo Test Instructions:
============================

The photo system has been updated to use real images from Lorem Picsum.

To test:
1. Make sure the server is running (npm run dev)
2. Open http://localhost:3000 
3. Start a new session
4. Click the "Debug" button (top-right)
5. Click "Take Fake Photo" in the debug sidebar
6. A real random portrait photo (800x1200) will be downloaded and added

Features:
- Each fake photo is a unique random image
- Photos are portrait-oriented (800x1200) 
- Images come from Lorem Picsum (free placeholder service)
- No more broken image icons!

The test photo API now fetches real images instead of 
creating invalid 1x1 pixel placeholders.
