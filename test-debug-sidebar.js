Debug Sidebar Test Instructions:
================================

1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Start a new session (if not already in one)
3. Navigate to the active session page
4. Look for the "Debug" button in the top-right corner
5. Click the "Debug" button to open the sidebar
6. The sidebar should slide in from the right
7. You should see the "Take Fake Photo" button in the sidebar
8. Click "Take Fake Photo" to add a test photo
9. The photo should appear in the grid
10. Click the X or backdrop to close the sidebar

Features to verify:
- Debug button only appears in development mode
- Sidebar slides in/out smoothly
- Backdrop appears behind sidebar
- Clicking backdrop closes sidebar
- "Take Fake Photo" button works from sidebar
- Button is disabled when max photos reached

The fake photo button is now exclusively in the debug sidebar
for better organization of development tools.
