# Step 2: Product Requirements Document (PRD) Prompt

## Context
You are creating a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the selected project idea from Step 1. This PRD will serve as the foundation for architecture design and development planning.

## Input Required
- The selected project idea from Step 1 ideation
- Any additional requirements or constraints

## Your Task
Create a detailed PRD that includes all sections below. Be specific and actionable.

## PRD Structure

### 1. Executive Summary
- Project name and tagline
- Brief description (2-3 sentences)
- Key value proposition
- Success metrics

### 2. Problem Statement & Opportunity
- Detailed problem description
- Market opportunity size
- Current solutions and their limitations
- Why now? (timing/market conditions)

### 3. Target Users & Personas
- Primary user persona (detailed)
- Secondary user personas
- User journey and pain points
- User goals and motivations

### 4. Product Vision & Goals
- Long-term vision (1-2 years)
- Success criteria and KPIs
- Business objectives
- User experience objectives

### 5. Functional Requirements

#### 5.1 Core Features (MVP)
For each feature:
- Feature name
- User story (As a... I want... So that...)
- Acceptance criteria
- Priority (P0/P1/P2)

#### 5.2 Advanced Features (Post-MVP)
- Future enhancements
- Nice-to-have features
- Scalability considerations

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements
- Scalability requirements
- Accessibility requirements
- Browser/device compatibility

### 7. Technical Constraints & Assumptions

- Third-party integrations
- Data requirements
- API dependencies
- Infrastructure considerations

### 8. User Experience Requirements
- Key user flows
- Design principles
- Responsive design requirements
- Accessibility standards

### 9. Success Metrics & Analytics
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- User engagement metrics
- Technical performance metrics
- Business metrics

### 10. Timeline & Milestones
- High-level development phases
- Key milestones and deliverables
- Dependencies and risks

### 11. Out of Scope
- What we won't build in v1
- Future considerations
- Explicitly excluded features

## Output Requirements
- Be specific and avoid ambiguity
- Include user stories for all major features
- Prioritize features clearly
- Consider technical feasibility
- Think about scalability from day one

## Deliverable
A complete PRD that can guide the architecture design phase and serve as a reference throughout development.
