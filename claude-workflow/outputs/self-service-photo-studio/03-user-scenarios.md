# User Scenarios & Workflow Design: SnapStudio

**Date**: 2025-07-23  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Based on**: PRD v1.0

## Executive Summary

SnapStudio transforms the chaotic self-service photo studio experience into structured, manageable sessions. The key user scenarios revolve around two primary personas: **Sarah (Studio Customer)** who needs guided photo sessions with easy selection, and **Mr. Kim (Studio Owner)** who needs reliable software that reduces customer support.

**Critical User Flows**:
1. **Guided Photo Session** - 9-photo pose sessions with real-time review
2. **Photo Selection & Organization** - Immediate starring with automatic file management
3. **Session Completion** - Easy access to organized favorite photos

**Success Metrics**: 85% session completion rate, 60% faster photo selection, seamless studio integration.

## 1. Primary User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First-Time Photo Session (Happy Path)
**User Persona**: Sarah (Studio Customer)  
**Context**: Sarah visits a self-service studio for graduation photos, first time using SnapStudio  
**Preconditions**: Studio computer is running SnapStudio, camera is connected and working  
**Success Criteria**: Sarah completes multiple pose sessions, successfully selects favorites, exits with organized photos

**Workflow Steps**:
1. **App Launch**: Sarah clicks SnapStudio icon → Application opens with welcome screen → Sarah sees clean, intuitive interface with "Start New Session" button
2. **Pose Selection**: Sarah clicks "Start New Session" → Pose library displays with visual examples → Sarah browses categories (Portrait, Full-body, Sitting) and feels inspired by variety
3. **Session Setup**: Sarah selects "Professional Portrait" pose → System shows session setup screen with pose guidance image → Sarah sees "Session 1: Professional Portrait - Photo 1 of 9" and feels confident about structure
4. **Photo Taking**: Sarah takes first photo → Photo appears on screen within 2 seconds → Sarah continues taking photos, watching progress "Photo 2 of 9", "Photo 3 of 9"...
5. **Session Review**: After 9th photo → Grid of all 9 photos appears instantly → Sarah quickly taps/clicks stars on her 3 favorite photos, feeling efficient
6. **Continue Sessions**: Sarah clicks "New Pose Session" → Selects "Full Body Standing" → Repeats process for 2 more sessions
7. **Session Completion**: Sarah clicks "Finish & View Selected" → Sees grid of all starred photos from all sessions → Sarah clicks "Access My Photos" and sees organized folders

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Alt 1 (Pose Change Mid-Session)**: If Sarah wants different pose after 4 photos → System allows early session completion → Starred photos saved → New session starts
- **Alt 2 (Unstar Photos)**: During review, Sarah changes mind → Can click starred photos to unstar → Visual feedback shows change immediately

**Edge Cases**:
- Camera stops working mid-session → System detects no new photos → Shows friendly error message and suggests checking camera
- No photos starred in session → System asks "No favorites? Would you like to review again or continue?"
- Multiple people taking turns → System treats each 9-photo session independently

**Frequency**: High (every customer visit)  
**Importance**: Critical (core user experience)  
**Complexity**: Medium (multiple screens, state management)  
**Risk Level**: High (poor experience loses customers)

---

### Scenario 2: Quick Session for Experienced User
**User Persona**: Sarah (returning customer)  
**Context**: Sarah returns for quick headshots, familiar with SnapStudio  
**Preconditions**: Same setup, Sarah knows the interface  
**Success Criteria**: Rapid session completion with efficient photo selection

**Workflow Steps**:
1. **Quick Start**: Sarah opens app → Immediately recognizes interface → Clicks "Start New Session"
2. **Rapid Pose Selection**: Sarah quickly selects familiar "Business Headshot" pose → Skips guidance, starts shooting immediately
3. **Efficient Review**: After 9 photos → Sarah rapidly stars 4 photos using keyboard shortcuts (spacebar to star)
4. **Immediate Completion**: Sarah clicks "Finish & Access" → Gets her organized photos quickly

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Alt 1 (Multiple Quick Sessions)**: Sarah does 3 rapid sessions back-to-back → System handles state transitions smoothly
- **Alt 2 (Custom Pose)**: Sarah selects "Custom Pose" option → Adds her own pose name → System adapts to user preference

**Frequency**: Medium (returning customers)  
**Importance**: High (user retention)  
**Complexity**: Low (streamlined flow)  
**Risk Level**: Medium (must remain efficient)

---

### Scenario 3: Studio Owner Setup and Monitoring
**User Persona**: Mr. Kim (Studio Owner)  
**Context**: Setting up SnapStudio on studio computer, monitoring customer usage  
**Preconditions**: Fresh installation, basic computer setup completed  
**Success Criteria**: Software configured correctly, customers use it independently

**Workflow Steps**:
1. **Initial Configuration**: Mr. Kim opens SnapStudio settings → Sets camera output directory → Sets organized photo output location → Tests with sample photos
2. **Customer Orientation**: First customer arrives → Mr. Kim shows 30-second demo → Customer uses software independently
3. **Passive Monitoring**: Mr. Kim observes customers using software → Notes reduced help requests → Sees organized photo folders being created automatically
4. **End-of-Day Review**: Mr. Kim checks system status → Reviews any error logs → Confirms all customer sessions completed successfully

**Alternative Flows**:
- **Alt 1 (Configuration Issues)**: Directory permissions wrong → System shows clear error message → Mr. Kim fixes permissions easily
- **Alt 2 (Customer Needs Help)**: Customer confused → Mr. Kim provides quick guidance → Customer continues independently

**Frequency**: Low (setup once, occasional monitoring)  
**Importance**: High (business operations)  
**Complexity**: Low (simple configuration)  
**Risk Level**: High (must work reliably)
